#  Research Paper Summarizer - Multi-Agent System 

This is a Python-based **multi-agent system** that automates research paper processing. It supports PDF ingestion (local or URL), topic classification, summarization, and generates an audio podcast version of the summary. All outputs are neatly saved in topic-specific folders for easy access and organization.
